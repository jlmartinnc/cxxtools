Tools
=====

Two command line tools are offered by cxxtools.

siconvert
---------

The tool `siconvert` allows converting between various formats.

A short introduction is printed when the tools is called without
arguments. Data can be read from standard in and output is written to
standard out. The tool can also be used to format files nicely.

The input format is typically passed as a small cap letter and the output
format with a capital letter. The flag -d enables nicely formatted output
(think of "display").

### Examples:

convert csv data to json:

    cat "foo.csv" | siconvert -cJd

convert (cxxtools-)binary data to xml

    cat "foo.bin" | siconvert -bXd

format a existing json file

    cat "foo.json" | siconvert -jJd

cxxtz
-----

The tool `cxxtz` is a command line tool to handle time zones. A short
introduction is printed when the tools is called without arguments.

### Examples:

List all known time zones of the system:

    cxxtz -a

Print the current time in the zime zone Pacific/Nauru

    cxxtz -c -z Pacific/Nauru
